Before execution, your directory should look like this:

.../
	/dataset
	/source
		/Main.py
		/*.py

Note:

Main.py runs the program, the other files are the subprograms run by main.py.

Please adjust the ‘root_path’ in our code file to the dataset folder. Note that you should use an absolute path, using a relative path will lead to an error.

We have tested our code on a machine with 'Python 3.6.9' and made sure it's executable. If you encounter any problem executing our code file, please contact us.
