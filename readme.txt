Before execution, your directory should look like this:

.../
	/dataset
	/source
		/Main.py
		/*.py

Note:

Main.py runs the program, the other files are the subprograms run by Main.py.

Please adjust the ‘root_path’ in our code file to the dataset folder. Note that you should use an absolute path, using a relative path may lead to an error.

We have tested our code on a machine with 'Python 3.6.9' and made sure it's executable. If you encounter any problem executing our code file, please contact us.

The jupyter notebook version can be run on Google Colaboratory (using TPU backend), but it's just for reference.

The dataset can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A3Wis_sj8ZFTItO_vu_kla-5Oh1iOkm5?usp=sharing
